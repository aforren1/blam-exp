# Installation (General)

1. Install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
  - It doesn't *really* matter whether you install the version based off of Python 2.7 or 3.6, as it doesn't affect your subsequent environments. I would suggest erring toward newer versions, though.
  - (optional) Add conda to your path (otherwise, you need to use the "Anaconda Prompt")
2. (optional) Install the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
  - Definitely not necessary, but gets you easy access to a debugger, "projects", auto-completion, etc.
  - To get access to proper auto-completion, add the environment's interpreter via File -> Settings -> Project: <name\> -> Project Interpreter -> Hit the gear in the upper right corner -> Add local
 
 # Installation (Windows)
 (If using the Kinereach) Install the driver for the Keyspan 49WG (4-port serial to USB adapter). Ours is version 1 [here](https://www.tripplite.com/shared/software/Driver/Keyspan-Driver-for-USA-49WG-v1-%20v3.8.1-Windows-XP-and-later.zip).

I *think* it's good to have [asio4all](http://www.asio4all.de/), but haven't dealt with before w.r.t. psychopy...
